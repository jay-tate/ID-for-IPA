Toward an Instructional Design Document on the topic of the International Phonetic Alphabet

Week 1: Instructional Design Topic & Learning Gap (Nov 6, 2023)

TOPIC: Using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

LEARNING GAP: At present, the only readilly available instructional materials for learning to use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) are designed for the specialized use of linguistics students. Those materials, however, tend to be highly technical and presume a regular, immersive, and career-spanning use of IPA. This instructional bias results in a learning gap between linguists and everyone else. 

Bridging this particular gap with a mini-course has practical implications for a variety of applied fields where there are less-frequent, less-intensive but more widespread potential use cases. These under-served potential users include second language learners, singers of foreign language vocal music, and actors working on dialects or foreign accents. Some of these potential users of the IPA may even be have been briefly told about the clarifying power of the IPA during the study of other fields such as Communications, Education, Theater, or Music. Yet such students rarely have any opportunity to experience an efficient way to acquire (or reacquire) IPA skills to a usable level for their own purposes. As a result, even potential users who may have heard of IPA (in connection with anything other than the unrelated abbreviation for India Pale Ale beer!) end up becomg another case of "Tell me, and I forget."

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: There are ethical, accessibility, and AI considerations to address for this project. 

-Ethical:  Any phonetic representation of the sounds of a given language is only one of multiple possible representations. The further a given speaker's native way of speaking diverges from standardized pronunciations found "in the dictionary", the more that they will face additional hurdles making fluent usage of IPA for their own language. The instructional examples should include sufficient attention to the variety of pronunciations with which target learners are most familiar.

-Accessibility: IPA transcriptions of speech sounds raise accessibility issues for both viewers and listeners. 

For viewers: V1) Larger font sizes for viewers: the unfamiliar letters and symbols of the IPA "alphabet" will need to be zoomable (or rendered much larger by default), so that viewers with weaker eyesight will still be able to learn and distinguish the shapes of each symbol. V2) According to Wikipedia's Help:IPA page, "Free fonts with good IPA support include Gentium Plus (serif) and Andika (sans-serif)." Which fonts with good IPA support also work well for more general accessibility? 

For listeners: L1) Alternative text representations for viewers unable to listen: Merely putting a dictionary word on screen together with a dictionary rendering of IPA will sometimes leave some viewers unclear what sound is actuallly being conveyed. L2) Whatever the font choice, the final presentation should take care to present IPA fonts in text, not merely as images unreadable to machine readers. 

-AI: One of the attractions of taking on this project in late 2023 into early 2024 is how efficiently current AI can handle batch queries that previously would have taken geometrically longer to answer using the single-item queries of a pre-2022 search engine. 

For example (exploring a possible a sample activity for learners), I asked Perplexity.ai to generate a list of Shakespeare's ten most famous plays with each title transcribed in IPA -- which it did successfully! To the extent that such successes can be multiplied across many other examples, and it becomes readily possible to generate a large number of appealing activities for non-specialist learners, reducing both the tedious work of typing the examples and reducing the input needed from linguistics SMEs. 

So, there are strong attractions to using AI for this project. However, the use of AI also raises additional factual and ethical issues. 

-factual: The AI will make mistakes. As 
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533158)/">"The Fallacy of Functionality" (2022)</a> makes clear, the most hurdles are all the ways that AI can fail, whether due to impossible tasks, engineering failures, post-deployment failures, or communication failures.

My own brief exploratory testing already suggests that every piece AI-generated teaching material must be fact-checked. For instance, in reponse to another query, the first result from Perplexity.io read as follows: 

"Here are the ten largest countries in the world, along with their pronunciation in American English and in the local standard language:"

       Russia - /ˈrʌʃə/ (American English) - /ˈrʌʃə/ (Russian: Россия) 

Note, unfortunately for the AI, that the supposedly "Russian" pronunciation given for the largest country in the world is identical to the English pronunciation! Correcting this incorrect piece of information required noticing the mistake, re-querying for the correct pronunciation of the Cyrillic spelling, and manually inserting the separately-generated correct pronunciation into a larger list: 

        "Overall, the pronunciation of Россия in Russian is: /rɐˈsʲijə/ (ross-SEE-ya)."

-ethical: Any reliable results generated by AI depend on using the careful, authoritative work of linguistics experts, whether in dictionaries, or more specialized works. In fact, even in the simple case of generating IPA transcriptions for the titles of works by Shakespeare, the AI cited use of a specialized book still in copyright entitled <i>All the Words on Stage: A Complete Pronunciation Dictionary for the Plays of William Shakespeare</i> (2002)  https://www.amazon.com/All-Words-Stage-Pronunciation-Shakespeare/dp/1575252147

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription)/">"Phonetic transcription"</a>: Wikipedia is succinct on the tradeoffs of narrow transcription (more detailed but complex) versus broad transcription (less detailed but easier), concluding, "A rule of thumb in many linguistics contexts is therefore to use a narrow transcription when it is necessary for the point being made, but a broad transcription whenever possible." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription 

<i>Accents & Dialects for Stage and Screen: Deluxe Edition</i> (2020), revised edition 426 pp, by Paul Meier. Authoritative but overkill for most beginners, given that it includes detailed coverage of twenty-seven dialects and accents of English plus many foreign language accents for speakers of English. https://www.amazon.com/Accents-Dialects-Stage-Screen-streaming/dp/1938029909
