Instructional Design Topic & Learning Gap

Topic: Using the International Phonetic Alphabet

Learning Gap: Only linguistics students have materials for learning the IPA, but those materials are overly technical and presume a career-long use of IPA. Other potential use cases (including second language learners, singers of foreign language works, and actors working on dialects and foreign accents) do not have a more efficient way to acquire IPA skills sufficient to make use them on a relatively rare as-needed basis.
